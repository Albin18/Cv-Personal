# Cv with HTML and CSS

# HTML

We form the template in HTML.
We create a left container, for personal data or contact information and then we create a right container to show our skills, knowledge and our work experience or education.

1. left container:
We define our template and separate the spaces to implement our profile photo and our contact information, either our LINKEDIN profile or our GITHUB repository.

2. rigth container:
In our right template, we are going to define our professional skills, certified studies as well as our qualifications, optionally highlight my mastered technologies as well as the frameworks with known images.

3. Use of FontAwesome to detail the icons of our links for more detail to our CV.
